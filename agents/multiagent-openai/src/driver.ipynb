      "# Comparison of Annual Net Income Growth: BAC vs AXP (2013-2022)\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the analysis of the past 10 years of net income data for Bank of America (BAC) and American Express (AXP), here's a comprehensive comparison:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Scale Difference**: BAC operates at a significantly larger scale than AXP, with an average annual net income of $20.13 billion compared to AXP's $5.69 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Total Growth**: From 2013 to 2022, BAC experienced much stronger total growth at 140.82%, while AXP grew by 40.21%.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)**: BAC achieved a CAGR of 10.26%, substantially outperforming AXP's 3.83%.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Growth Patterns\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Volatility**: Both companies showed high volatility in their growth rates, but BAC experienced more extreme fluctuations (standard deviation of 92.44% vs. 73.99% for AXP).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Positive Growth Years**:\n",
      "   - BAC had 6 years of positive growth (2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2021)\n",
      "   - AXP had 5 years of positive growth (2013, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2021)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Negative Growth Years**:\n",
      "   - BAC had 4 years of negative growth (2014, 2019, 2020, 2022)\n",
      "   - AXP had 5 years of negative growth (2015, 2017, 2019, 2020, 2022)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Growth Extremes**:\n",
      "   - BAC's highest growth: 228.74% in 2015\n",
      "   - AXP's highest growth: 157.10% in 2021\n",
      "   - BAC's lowest growth: -57.72% in 2014\n",
      "   - AXP's lowest growth: -53.62% in 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "## Response to Economic Events\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Low Correlation**: The correlation between BAC and AXP's growth rates is relatively weak (0.2104), indicating they often respond differently to market conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Key Years**:\n",
      "   - **2014**: AXP grew 9.82% while BAC declined sharply by 57.72%\n",
      "   - **2015**: BAC rebounded dramatically with 228.74% growth while AXP declined by 12.27%\n",
      "   - **2018**: Both companies showed strong growth (AXP: 152.96%, BAC: 54.38%)\n",
      "   - **2020 (COVID-19)**: Both companies were negatively impacted, with AXP (-53.62%) suffering more than BAC (-34.76%)\n",
      "   - **2021 (Recovery)**: Both showed strong rebounds, with AXP growing faster (157.10% vs. BAC's 78.71%)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Insights\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Resilience**: BAC has demonstrated greater overall growth and resilience over the decade, with a stronger CAGR and higher total growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Pandemic Impact**: Both companies were significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, showing substantial declines, but both rebounded strongly in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Different Business Models**: The low correlation in growth patterns reflects their different business models and customer bases - BAC as a diversified banking institution and AXP as a payment services provider focused on premium customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Recent Performance**: Both companies experienced negative growth in 2022 (BAC: -13.92%, AXP: -6.77%), suggesting similar challenges in the most recent economic environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consistency**: Neither company showed consistent year-over-year growth, with both experiencing significant ups and downs throughout the decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while BAC has demonstrated stronger overall growth and operates at a much larger scale, both companies have shown resilience through economic cycles, with different patterns of recovery from downturns. BAC's performance has been more volatile but ultimately delivered higher long-term growth rates compared to AXP.\n"

# Multi-Agent System with Agent Bricks

# Introduction
Create a multi-agent system on Databricks with Agent Bricks. You will create
* A `Genie Space` with two datasets `balance-sheet` and `income-statement`
* A `Vector Search Index` of a chunked SEC 10K dataset `sec-10k-chunked`
* A `Knowledge Assistant` that's connected to the Vector Search Index
* A `Multi-Agent Supervisor` that's a coordinator between the `Genie Space` and the `Knowledge Assistant`

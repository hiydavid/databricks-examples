pursuant to the terms of this Paragraph 4 until expiration of the term of the lease covering such space, including all renewals and expansions thereof.
In the event Landlord fails to notify Tenant that an Expansion Space is available in accordance with this Article, then Tenant’s sole remedy in such event shall be to terminate this Lease upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to Landlord.
5. Prohibited Persons and Transactions. Tenant represents and warrants to Landlord that Tenant is currently in compliance with, and Tenant further covenants to Landlord that Tenant shall at all times during the term of the Lease (including any extension thereof) remain in compliance with, the regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of Treasury (including those named on OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List) and any statute, executive order (including, but not limited to, Executive Order 13224, dated September 24, 2001 and entitled “Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism”), or other governmental, regulatory, or administrative action relating thereto.
Except as otherwise provided in this Renewal Letter, all of the terms and provisions of the Lease shall be applicable during such extension period unless any such interpretation is expressly negated. Tenant acknowledges that there are no off-sets or defenses against enforcement of the Lease as of this date, and Landlord is not in default of any obligation thereunder.
The parties to this agreement desire to expedite the drafting and completion of this agreement. They acknowledge that the Lease, which is modified by this agreement, includes capitalized and defined terms. In order to avoid the delay which would be necessary to reference properly the capitalized and defined terms used in the Lease, the parties have elected rather to use generic terminology in this agreement rather than the defined terms of the Lease. For example, where the Lease may use the defined terms “Minimum Rent,” “Base Rent,” or “Fixed Minimum Rent,” this agreement will use the term “monthly minimum rental” to describe the regular monthly rental payments due under the Lease, as hereby modified. Any capitalized or defined terms used in this agreement, if any, will have the meanings ascribed to them in this agreement, which may or may not correspond to a similarly defined term in the Lease.
THE SUBMISSION OF THIS DOCUMENT FOR EXAMINATION AND/OR EXECUTION HEREOF SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE ONLY UPON EXECUTION BY ALL PARTIES HERETO AND DELIVERY OF A FULLY EXECUTED COUNTERPART BY LANDLORD TO THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the effective date of all of the terms and conditions of this Renewal Letter shall be deemed to be the date upon which the Renewal Letter is executed by Landlord.

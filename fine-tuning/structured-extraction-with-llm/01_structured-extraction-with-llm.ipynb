If any material part of the Project is sold or taken (whether or not the Premises are affected), Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease as of the date possession is transferred to the acquiring authority, upon giving written notice thereof to Tenant, and the rent payable hereunder shall be apportioned accordingly. Upon any taking of less than substantially all of the Premises, this Lease shall continue in force as to the part of the Premises not taken, and the rent payable thereafter shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of total floor area of the Premises taken.

If Tenant shall dispute any item or items included by Landlord in determining Operating Charges, Tenant shall nevertheless pay to Landlord in full the amount claimed by Landlord and shall not offset or withhold any payment while its dispute is pending.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, in the event that any part of the Project is exempted from real estate taxes, then Landlord may allocate the real estate taxes, assessments and charges payable with respect to the Project among the tenants occupying the taxable portion of the Project.\n3.3 Personal Property Taxes.

Landlord shall have the right to close any or all portions of the Common Areas to such extent as may, in Landlord’s opinion, be necessary to prevent a dedication thereof or the accrual of any rights to any person or the public therein, provided such closure shall not materially and adversely affect Tenant’s access to or use of the Premises or parking or signage rights under this Lease. Landlord shall at all times have full control, management and direction of the Common Areas. Tenant shall not cause or allow any storage of materials or equipment outside of the Premises on any of the Common Areas.

Tenant agrees to deposit or permit Landlord to deposit on Tenant’s behalf a key to the Premises in a lock box if required by and for the benefit of the local fire department.

Such comprehensive general liability insurance to be maintained by Landlord shall afford minimum protection of not less than $1,000,000 combined single limit coverage of bodily injury, property damage or combination thereof.\n19. WAIVER OF SUBROGATION. Each party hereby expressly releases the other for liability it may have on account of any loss to the Premises or Building or contents of either due to fire or any peril included in the coverage of any applicable fire and extended coverage and material damage insurance, however caused, including such losses as may be due to the negligence of the other party, its agents or employees, but only to the extent of any amount recovered by reason of such insurance, and each party hereby waives any right of subrogation which might otherwise exist in or accrue to such party on account thereof, provided that such release of liability and waiver of the right of subrogation shall not be operative in any case where the effect thereof is to invalidate such insurance coverage under applicable state law (or increase the cost thereof, unless the other party reimburses the insured for any cost increase). If Landlord or Tenant fails to maintain in force any insurance required by this Lease to be carried by it, then for purposes of this waiver of subrogation it shall be deemed to have been fully insured and to have recovered the entire amount of its loss.\n20. NON-LIABILITY OF LANDLORD. Except for any claim arising from the willful misconduct or negligence of Landlord, its agents, employees, or contractors, then, only to the extent such claims are not covered by insurance, Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant, and Tenant hereby waives all claims against Landlord, for any injury or damage to any person or property in or about the Project resulting from the Project, Building or Premises, or any part thereof or any equipment thereof becoming out of repair; flooding\n11\nof basements or other areas; damages caused by sprinkling devices, air-conditioning apparatus, snow, frost, water leakage, steam, excessive heat or cold, falling plaster, broken glass, sewage, gas, odors or noise or the bursting or leaking of pipes or plumbing fixtures; any act or neglect of Landlord or of other tenants or occupants or employees in the Project; or any other thing or circumstance whatsoever, whether of a like nature or of a wholly different nature. All property in or about the Project or in the Premises belonging to Tenant, its agents, employees or invitees shall be there at the risk of Tenant or other person only, and Landlord shall not be liable for damage thereto or theft, misappropriation or loss thereof except to the extent such shall damage, theft, misappropriation or loss is caused by the willful misconduct or negligence of Landlord, its agents, employees, or contractors. If Landlord shall fail to perform any covenant or condition of this Lease upon Landlord’s part to be performed and, as a consequence of such default, Tenant shall recover a money judgment against Landlord, such judgment shall be satisfied only out of the proceeds of sale received upon execution of such judgment and levied thereon against the right, title and interest of Landlord in the Project and out of rents or other income from such property receivable by Landlord and Landlord shall not be personally liable for any deficiency.\n21. CASUALTY. If the Premises are destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty covered by a standard fire and extended coverage policy, then (unless this Lease is terminated by Landlord as hereinafter provided) Landlord shall proceed, after adjustment of such loss, to repair or restore the Premises to the condition immediately prior to the casualty, and such repairs and restoration shall be completed within two hundred seventy (270) days after the date of the casualty. In no event shall Landlord be obligated to expend an amount in excess of the insurance proceeds available to Landlord for such repair or restoration. If Landlord repairs or restores the Premises as provided herein, then Tenant shall repair and restore its furnishings, furniture and equipment to at least a condition equal to that prior to its damage, but only to the extent Tenant receives sufficient insurance proceeds for such repairs and restoration. If the Premises or any part thereof shall be rendered untenantable by any destruction or damage, then a pro rata portion of the rent based upon the number of square feet of area in the Premises which are untenantable shall be abated until the Premises or such part thereof shall have been put in tenantable condition. If, however, any destruction or damage to the Premises, Building or Project (regardless of whether or not the Premises are affected) is so extensive that Landlord, in its sole discretion, elects not to repair or restore the Premises, Building or Project, or the proceeds of insurance are not sufficient or available to fully pay the cost of repair or restoration, then Landlord may terminate this Lease effective as of the date of the damage by written notice to Tenant within ninety (90) days after the date of the casualty. The provisions of this Section are subject to the rights of Landlord’s mortgagees, if any.\nNotwithstanding anything in this Section 21 to the contrary, if by reason of any casualty, the Premises are rendered untenantable in some material portion, and the amount of time estimated by Landlord required to repair the damage using due diligence is in excess of two hundred seventy (270) days, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving written notice of termination to Landlord within sixty (60) days after the date of casualty. Also, if during the last twelve months of the Term (as same may be extended) there should be a casualty loss to the Premises or the Building to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of the replacement value thereof or if the Premises are rendered untenantable for the conduct of Tenant’s business operations, Tenant may, at its option, terminate this Lease by giving written notice of termination to Landlord within sixty (60) days after the date of the casualty.\n22. CONDEMNATION. If all or substantially all of the Premises are sold to or taken by any public authority under its power of condemnation or the threat thereof, this Lease shall terminate as of the date possession shall be transferred to the acquiring authority, and the rent payable hereunder shall be apportioned accordingly. If any material part of the Project is sold or taken (whether or not the Premises are affected), Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease as of the date possession is transferred to the acquiring authority, upon giving written notice thereof to Tenant, and the rent payable hereunder shall be apportioned accordingly. Upon any taking of less than substantially all of the Premises, this Lease shall continue in force as to the part of the Premises not taken, and the rent payable thereafter shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of total floor area of the Premises taken. In the event of any such taking, Landlord, upon receipt and to the extent of the award in condemnation or proceeds of sale, shall, unless this Lease has been terminated, make necessary repairs and restorations to restore the Premises remaining to as near its former condition as circumstances will permit and to rebuild or restore the remainder of the\n12\nPremises to the approximate condition in which they existed at the time of such taking. In any event, all damages awarded by or amounts paid by the acquiring authority for any such taking, whether for the whole or a part of the Premises or the Building, Common Areas or Project, shall belong to and be the sole property of Landlord whether such damages are awarded as compensation for loss of, or diminution in value to, the leasehold or the fee thereof; provided, however, Tenant shall have the right to pursue such claim or claims as Tenant may have legally for the fair market value of Tenant’s Work actually paid for by Tenant (and not paid for by Landlord or from the Tenant Improvement Allowance), its leasehold estate, relocation expenses, interruption of business and such items which do not reduce the award or proceeds of sale payable to Landlord. In the event that this Lease is terminated as hereinabove provided, Tenant shall not have any claim against Landlord for the value of the unexpired term hereof. The provisions of this Paragraph are subject to the rights of Landlord’s mortgagees, if any.\nIf a substantial portion of the Premises or the Building is taken under the power of condemnation (including any conveyance made in lieu thereof) or if any taking of the Premises, Building or any common areas of or serving the Building shall materially impair the normal operation of Tenant’s business, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving written notice of such termination within thirty (30) days after such taking.\n23. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING. Tenant shall not assign, pledge, mortgage or otherwise transfer or encumber this Lease or sublet any part or all of the Premises and shall not permit any use of any part of the Premises by any other party, or any transfer of as interest in the Premises by operation of law without Landlord’s consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or denied; provided, however, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Tenant shall be permitted to assign this Lease or sublet all or any portion of the Premises, without the consent of Landlord, (i) to an entity into which Tenant may merge, which Tenant may acquire, or which Tenant may consolidate with, (ii) to any parent or subsidiary of Tenant, or (iii) to a purchaser of substantially all of Tenant’s assets or a controlling interest in the outstanding voting stock of Tenant (iv) to any entity which is affiliated with Tenant or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Tenant.. The following shall be deemed to be an assignment of this Lease within the meaning of this Paragraph: (a) the sale, issuance or transfer of any voting stock of Tenant (if Tenant be a nonpublic corporation or if Tenant is a public corporation and such sale, issuance or transfer results in Tenant becoming a nonpublic corporation) which results in a change in voting control of Tenant; (b) the sale, issuance or transfer of any partnership interest in Tenant if Tenant be a partnership; (c) the change or conversion of a general or limited partnership to a limited liability company, limited liability partnership or any other entity which possesses the characteristics of limited liability; (d) the sale, issuance or transfer of any beneficial interest in Tenant if Tenant be a trust; and (e) the death or incapacity of Tenant if Tenant be a natural person. Without waiving Landlord’s right hereunder to declare a default in the event of an assignment of this Lease or a subletting of the Premises or any part thereof or occupancy of the Premises by anyone other than Tenant, Landlord may collect from the assignee, sublessee or occupant, any rental and other charges herein required, but such collection by Landlord shall not be deemed an acceptance of the assignee, sublessee or occupancy, nor a release of Tenant from the performance by Tenant of this Lease. Further, Tenant at all times and under all circumstances shall remain liable to Landlord for the payment of rent due and to become due and the performance of all other obligations of Tenant hereunder for the term hereof. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, any costs and expenses including reasonable attorney fees incurred by Landlord in connection with any proposed or purported assignment, sublease or other transfer requiring Landlord’s consent, such total amount not to exceed $1,500.\nAll option rights, extension rights, renewal rights, expansion rights, and rights of first refusal will flow through to all assignees or subtenants.\n24. DEFAULT. If (a) Tenant shall fail to pay the rent or any charge due hereunder within five (5) days after written notice from Landlord, or (b) Tenant shall fail to perform any of the other covenants or conditions herein contained on the part of Tenant, and such default shall continue for thirty (30) days after written notice thereof shall have been given to Tenant (except that such thirty (30) day period shall be automatically extended for an additional period of time reasonably necessary to cure such default, if such default cannot be cured within such thirty (30) day period and provided Tenant commences the process of curing such\n13\ndefault within said thirty (30) day period and continuously and diligently prosecutes such cure to completion, and except that, if Tenant fails to timely deliver any subordination instruments under Section 30 or estoppel certificates under Section 32, no additional grace period shall be allowed beyond the ten (10) days referred to in such sections), or (c) if this Lease shall, by act of Tenant or by operation of law or otherwise, pass to any party other than Tenant in violation of this Lease, or (d) intentionally deleted, or (e) Tenant or any guarantor of this Lease shall become insolvent or bankrupt or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (f) a receiver or trustee of Tenant’s property or that of any guarantor of this Lease shall be appointed and such receiver or trustee, as the case may be, shall not be discharged within thirty (30) days after such appointment, or (g) an execution or attachment is levied against Tenant’s property or that of any guarantor of this Lease and is not bonded or otherwise removed within thirty (30) days, Landlord may, upon notice to Tenant, recover possession of and reenter the Premises without affecting Tenant’s liability for past rent and other charges due or future rent and other charges to accrue hereunder. In the event of any such default beyond any applicable notice and cure period, Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant, in addition to rent and other charges equivalent to rent, all other damages sustained by Landlord on account of the breach of this Lease, including, but not limited to, reasonable the costs, expenses and attorney fees incurred by Landlord in enforcing the terms and provisions hereof and in reentering and recovering possession of the Premises and for the cost of repairs, alterations and brokerage and attorney fees connected with the reletting of the Premises. Further, at the election of Landlord, Landlord shall have the right to declare this Lease terminated and cancelled, without any further rights or obligations on the part of Landlord or Tenant (other than Tenant’s obligation for rent and other charges due and owing through the date of termination), so that Landlord may relet the Premises without any right on the part of Tenant to any credit or payment resulting from any reletting of the Premises. In case of a default under this Lease beyond any applicable notice and cure period, Landlord may, in addition to terminating this Lease, or in lieu thereof, pursue such other remedy or combination or remedies and recover such other damages for breach of tenancy and/or contract as available at law or otherwise.\nLandlord may, but shall not be obligated to, cure any default by Tenant (specifically including, but not by way of limitation, Tenant’s failure to obtain insurance, make repairs, or satisfy lien claims) and whenever Landlord so elects, all reasonable costs and expenses paid by Landlord in curing such default, including without limitation attorney fees, shall be payable to Landlord as additional rent due on demand, together with interest at the rate provided in Section 26 below from the date of the advance to the date of repayment by Tenant to Landlord.\nA waiver by Landlord of a breach or default by Tenant under the terms and conditions of this Lease shall not be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default nor of any other term or condition of this Lease, and the failure of Landlord to assert any breach or to declare a default by Tenant shall not be construed to constitute a waiver thereof so long as such breach or default continues unremedied.\nNo receipt of money by Landlord from Tenant after the expiration or termination of this Lease or after the service of any notice or after the commencement of any suit, or after final judgment for possession of the Premises shall reinstate, continue or extend the Term of this Lease or affect any such notice, demand or suit.\nNotwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, following an default that is not timely cured under this Section 24, Landlord shall be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all damages which may accrue hereunder, at law or in equity as a result of any default or breach by Tenant of any of the terms of this Lease.\n25. COSTS AND ATTORNEY FEES. Tenant shall pay all costs, expenses and reasonable attorney fees that may be incurred or paid by Landlord in enforcing the covenants and agreements of this Lease, whether or not litigation is commenced.\n26. INTEREST. Any amount due from Tenant to Landlord hereunder which is not paid when due after any applicable notice and cure period shall bear interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of (i) five percent (5%) per annum in excess of the prime rate of interest announced, from time to time, by The Wall Street Journal, or, if such publication ceases publication, by another reputable financial periodical selected\n14\nby Landlord, or (ii) twelve percent (12%) per annum (but in no event shall such rate of interest exceed the maximum rate of interest permitted to be charged by law) (the “Default Rate”) from the date due until paid, compounded monthly, but the payment of such interest shall not excuse or cure any default by Tenant under this Lease.\n27. SURRENDER. Upon the termination of this Lease, by expiration or otherwise, Tenant shall peaceably surrender the Premises to Landlord broom-clean and in good condition and repair consistent with Tenant’s duty to make repairs as provided herein. All Alterations and decorations made to the Premises by Tenant shall remain and be the property of the Landlord unless Landlord shall require Tenant, at Tenant’s expense, to remove any or all thereof and repair the damage caused by such removal, such notice of removal of Alterations to be given to Tenant at the time such Alterations are approved by Landlord. All furniture, equipment and unattached movable personal property owned by Tenant may (and upon Landlord’s request shall) be removed from the Premises by Tenant no later than the termination date, and Tenant shall repair any and all damage caused by such removal.

Tenant shall also surrender all keys to the Premises and shall inform Landlord of combinations in any locks, safes and vaults, if any, in the Premises.\n28. HOLDOVER. In the event Tenant remains in possession of the Premises after the expiration of this Lease with the consent of Landlord and without the execution of a new lease, it shall be deemed to be occupying said premises as a tenant from month-to-month, subject to all of the conditions, provisions and obligations of this Lease insofar as the same are applicable to a month-to-month tenancy until the termination of such tenancy and the Base Rent shall be at 150% of the latest Base Rent applicable under this Lease.\n29. TRANSFER BY LANDLORD. In the event of a sale or conveyance by Landlord of the Building to a party that assumes in writing Landlord’s obligations under the Lease, the same shall operate to release Landlord from any future liability upon any of the covenants or conditions herein contained, and in such event Tenant agrees to look solely to the successor in interest of Landlord in and to this Lease. This Lease shall not be affected by any such sale or conveyance, and Tenant agrees to attorn to the purchaser or grantee, which shall be obligated on this Lease only so long as it is the owner of Landlord’s interest in and to this Lease.\n30. SUBORDINATION. Subject to and only upon execution by Tenant and the relevant lienholder of a subordination, nondisturbance and attornment agreement in form and content reasonably acceptable to Tenant and such lienholder, this Lease is and shall be subject and subordinate at all times to all ground or underlying leases which now exist or may hereafter be executed affecting the Building and to the lien of any mortgages now or hereafter placed on or against the Building, or on or against Landlord’s interest or estate therein, and including all extensions, renewals, amendments and supplements to any such lease or mortgage. Tenant covenants and agrees to execute and deliver to Landlord, within ten (10) days after request therefor from Landlord, such further instruments evidencing such subordination of this Lease to any ground or underlying leases and to the lien of any such mortgages as may be required by Landlord provided that any lessor under any such ground or underlying lease or the holder of any mortgage has agreed not to terminate or disturb Tenant’s right to use and occupy the Premises pursuant to the terms of this Lease so long as Tenant is not in default hereunder beyond any applicable notice and cure period. Failure of Tenant to execute and deliver such instrument within such ten (10) day period shall constitute a breach of this Lease. Further, Tenant hereby irrevocably appoints Landlord as attorney-in-fact for Tenant with full power and authority to execute and deliver in the name of Tenant any such instrument if Tenant fails to execute and deliver the same within the time period as aforesaid. Notwithstanding anything herein above contained in this Section, in the event the holder of any mortgage shall at any time elect to have this Lease constitute a prior and superior lien to its mortgage, then and in such event, upon any such holder notifying Tenant to that effect in writing, this Lease shall be deemed prior and superior in lien to such mortgage, whether this Lease is dated prior to or subsequent to the date of such mortgage.\n15\nLandlord will deliver to Tenant a non-disturbance agreement from any existing or future mortgagee or ground landlord of Landlord in favor of Tenant and in form and content reasonably acceptable to Tenant and such mortgagee or ground landlord, as applicable.\n31. MODIFICATIONS. Tenant agrees to execute any modification of this Lease which may be required by a lender as a condition to making a first mortgage loan on the Project; provided that no such modification shall alter the rent or term provided herein, or materially reduce the economic value hereof to Tenant, or materially affect Tenant’s business operations in the Premises, or increase Tenant’s financial obligations under this Lease. Tenant agrees to complete and promptly return any estoppel certificates that may be required in connection with any mortgage loan on the Building.

Tenant confirms that Landlord has made no representations or promises with respect to the Premises or the making or entry into of this Lease except as are expressly set forth herein, and agrees that no claim or liability shall be asserted by Tenant against Landlord for, and Landlord shall not be liable by reason of, breach of any representations or promises not expressly stated in this Lease.

Tenant further agrees to complete the forms in Exhibits G & H and/or supply other reasonably available employment data from time to time as requested by Landlord. Tenant agrees to complete such forms and provide such information in a timely manner upon request.\n42. OPTION TO EXPAND. Provided that Tenant is not then in default beyond any applicable cure period under Section 24, Tenant shall have the right to expand the Premises by up to 7,853 square feet on the first floor, 103 E Badger Road (the “First Floor Expansion Space”), at the same terms and conditions under this Lease (except for Base Rent as provided below) commencing any time after 12/31/2013 with one hundred eighty (180) day prior notice. If Tenant exercises its right to expand (gives notice) within the first eighteen (18) months of the Lease Term, Landlord shall provide a tenant improvement allowance of twenty-four and 77/100 dollars ($24.77) per square foot for the upfit of the First Floor Expansion Space and any additional upfit will be at Tenant’s expense. Base Rent for the First Floor Expansion Space shall be equal to $7.65 per rentable square foot escalated at two percent (2%) per annum with the escalation being calculated from the original Commencement Date of the Lease.\nTenant’s option to expand into the First Floor Expansion Space is subject to Landlord’s right to terminate as outlined in the existing Tenant’s current lease (AquaMost, Inc.) (the “AquaMost Lease”), which reads as follows: “Landlord reserves the right, provided the effective date of such termination is not before December 31, 2013, to relocate Tenant to substitute premises of comparable size within the Project Landlord shall provide Tenant with written notice by either: 1) 180 day notice, in which case Landlord will pay Tenant’s out of pocket costs incurred with moving its furniture and equipment, or 2) 120 day notice, in which case Landlord will pay Tenant $25,000 in addition to moving expenses described above (such additional fee shall not be paid if Landlord provides replacement property on terms acceptable to Tenant). If Landlord does not offer a suitable substitute location or if Tenant does not agree on the substitute location within thirty (30) days after receipt of Landlord’s notice, this Lease shall terminate at the end of either the one hundred eighty (180) or one hundred twenty (120) day period following Landlord’s notice.\nShould Tenant elect to expand into the First Floor Expansion Space and Landlord is obligated under the AquaMost Lease to pay the $25,000 and/or moving expense, Exact Sciences (Tenant) shall pay the actual, reasonable out of pocket expense to relocate AquaMost, Inc. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant recognizes Landlord’s desire to accommodate its other tenants in the building to the extent possible. To that end, Tenant agrees to work in good faith with Landlord to minimize negative impacts to such other\n17\ntenants as a result of exercising its expansion rights. This may include, to the extent practical, Tenant first exercising expansion rights in other areas of the building such as vacant space or the second floor space now occupied by Alexander Co. Further, Tenant agrees in good faith to provide notice whether formal or informal as early as possible giving Landlord as much time as possible to accommodate its other tenants.\nIn addition, provided that Landlord has not leased (subject to Tenant’s right of first refusal) the space to a 3rd party other than the Alexander Company, Tenant shall have the right to expand into 5,810 square feet (145 E Badger Road, Suite 200) on the second floor (the “Second Floor Expansion Space”) “as is” by giving written notice to Landlord within the first eighteen (18) months of the Lease. Base rent for the Second Floor Expansion Space shall be $13 / rsf NNN escalated at two percent (2%) per annum with the escalation being calculated from the original Commencement Date of the Lease. Landlord shall provide new paint and carpet as part of this expansion into the Second Floor Expansion Space. Tenant shall provide a one hundred twenty (120) day prior notice prior to the effective date of such expansion into the Second Floor Expansion Space.\nIf Tenant expands into either the First Floor Expansion Space or the Second Floor Expansion Space, Tenant shall extend the term of this Lease for a period of five (5) years from the effective date of the expansion, and such extension shall not be deemed an exercise of the Extension Option by Tenant.\nIn addition, Tenant shall have the right to expand into 3,189 square feet, if such room is not included in such square footage total, (145 E Badger Road, Suite 102) on the first floor (the “Suite 102 Expansion Space”) by giving written notice to Landlord within the first twelve (12) months of the Lease. Base rent for the Suite 102 Expansion Space shall be $13 / rsf NNN escalated at two percent (2%) per annum with the escalation being calculated from the original Commencement Date of the Lease. Landlord shall provide a tenant improvement allowance of four and 00/100 dollars ($4.00) per square foot per remaining lease year (including any pro-rata amount for any partial year remaining) for the upfit of the Suite 102 Expansion Space and any additional upfit will be at Tenant’s expense. Tenant shall provide sixty (60) days prior notice of its desire to expand into the Suite 102 Expansion Space to allow Landlord to prepare such space for delivery to Tenant and such space shall be added to the Premises no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after such notice. Tenant’s expansion into the Suite 102 Expansion Space shall be subject to Landlord’s ability to terminate the lease of any existing tenant in such space or relocate such tenant which Landlord shall use all reasonable efforts to do if Tenant exercises its right to expand into the Suite 102 Expansion Space. Further, Tenant shall have the right to expand into the existing campus common conference room on the first floor of the building (the “Conference Room”) by giving written notice to Landlord within the first twelve (12) months of the Lease. Base rent for the Conference Room shall be $13 / rsf NNN escalated at two percent (2%) per annum with the escalation being calculated from the original Commencement Date of the Lease. Landlord shall provide a tenant improvement allowance of four and 00/100 dollars ($4.00) per square foot per remaining lease year (including any pro-rata amount for any partial year remaining) for the upfit of the Conference Room and any additional upfit will be at Tenant’s expense. Tenant shall provide sixty (60) days prior notice of its desire to expand into the Conference Room to allow Landlord to prepare such space for delivery to Tenant and such space shall be added to the Premises no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after such notice. Tenant’s expansion into the Conference Room shall be subject to Landlord’s ability to replace the Conference Room in another building in the Novation Campus at such time as suitable space becomes available at Landlord’s discretion.\nIf Tenant expands into the Suite 102 Expansion Space or the Conference Room, Tenant shall not be required to extend the term of this Lease unless expressly required to do so under the terms of the other expansion options described in this Section.\n43. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL. Provided that Tenant is not then in default beyond any applicable cure period under Section 24, Tenant will also have an ongoing Right of First Refusal on all remaining space within the Building (the “ROFR”). If, during the term of the ROFR, Landlord receives a bona fide offer or letter of intent to lease any space within the Building (the “Additional Space”)(the “Offer”), and Landlord desires to accept the Offer, then Landlord shall deliver to Tenant written notice of Landlord’s intention to accept the Offer (the “Notice”), together with a copy of the Offer certified by Landlord to be a true and complete copy (such copy may have the identity of the offeror or omitted). Tenant shall then have ten (10)\n18\ndays, beginning with the date of delivery of the Notice, in which to notify Landlord in writing of Tenant’s election to amend this Lease to incorporate the Additional Space into this Lease on terms identical to those set forth in the Offer. If Tenant exercises the ROFR by written notice given to Landlord within such ten (10)-day period, then Landlord and Tenant shall enter into an amendment to this Lease to incorporate into his Lease the Additional Space in accordance with the provisions of said Offer. If, within ten (10) days of delivery by Landlord to Tenant of the Notice, Tenant has failed to exercise the ROFR pursuant to the terms of this Section, then the ROFR shall be null, void and of no further force and effect whatsoever as it applies to the Additional Space, provided that Landlord and the tenant that submitted the Offer enter into a binding lease in accordance with the Offer terms within 120 days after the date of the Notice. The ROFR shall not apply to any options to extend that are currently contained in any existing leases.\n44. BROKERS. Landlord and Tenant represent and warrant each to the other that they have not dealt with any broker(s) or any other person claiming any entitlement to any commission in connection with this transaction except Broadwing Advisors (Craig Stanley) who represented Tenant and Alexander/RE (Andrew Schmidt) who represented Landlord (collectively, the “Brokers”). Tenant agrees to indemnify and save Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, suits, liabilities, costs, judgments and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, for any leasing commissions or other commissions, fees, charges or payments resulting from or arising out of its respective actions in connection with this Lease. Landlord agrees to indemnify and save Tenant harmless from and against any and all claims, suits, liabilities, costs, judgments and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, for any leasing commissions or other commissions, fees, charges or payments resulting from or arising out of its actions in connection with this Lease. Landlord agrees to be responsible for the leasing commission due the Brokers pursuant to a separate written agreement between Landlord and the Brokers, and to hold Tenant harmless respecting same.\n19\nEXECUTED as of the date first written above.\nLANDLORD:\nTENANT:\nTech Building I, LLC\nExact Sciences Laboratories, Inc.\nBy: Mid-Town Center, LLC, Manager\nBy:\n/s/ Matthew D.

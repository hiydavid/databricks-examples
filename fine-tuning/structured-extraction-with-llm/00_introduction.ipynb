    "## Best practices on prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and synthetic data generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured extraction from unstructured data is one of the most important use cases for enterprises today. In this series of notebooks, we demonstrate how to use Databricks Mosaic AI functionalities to perform this task. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a lease agreement dataset[1] throughout this demo:\n",
    "  * You were only given a small sample of 100 lease contracts and their human-curated labels\n",
    "  * The labels are entity extractions in a structured format (i.e. JSON)\n",
    "  * Fields are: `end_date`, `leased_space`, `lessee`, `lessor`, `signing_date`, `start_date`, `term_of_payment`, `designated_use`, `extension_period`, and `expiration_date_of_lease`\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we demonstrate how to do structured extraction using the Llama 3.1 70B model, which comes with structured output enabled (i.e. function calling), and evaluate the results against the ground-truth labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we demonstrate how to use existing data to generate more synthetic data using the Llama 3.1 405B model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we show how to fine-tune a Llama 3.2 3B model witht the synthetic data, serve it on a Provisioned Throughput endpoint, perform batch structured extraction using `ai_query`, and then evaluate the results against the ground-truth labels, as well as the bigger, Llama 3.1 70B, model.\n",
